Description: Contains tools to analyze data (to load, summarize and visualize multiple 
    multivariate time series sensor data), to prepare data (for data preparation, including 
    data cleaning, feature engineering and data transforms), to build and evaluate predictive 
    maintenance models (for using a large number of machine learning agorithms which are 
    available in R, including linear, non-linear, trees, esembles for regression, algorithm 
    evaluation and model selection).
